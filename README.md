# GitHub Users API

[View the demo](https://github-user-search-2.netlify.app)

## Overview

A simple user interface to query GitHub's Users API.

This tech stack is what I'd use when creating an enterprise web application. While the UI is fairly simple, I wanted to show how I'd approach creating a new repo from scratch.

The inclusion of Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript, and Cypress helps bake in quality from the get go.

## Technologies Used

‚öõÔ∏è React for building out the user interface
üí™üèæ TypeScript as the primary language to keep things strong(ly typed).
üõ† Cypress for E2E testing
üßº ESLint + Prettier for keeping code clean
‚ö°Ô∏è Vite for a quick and easy development environment
‚òÅÔ∏è Netlify for simple deployments

## Things worth noting

### Constructing my own pagination URLs instead of using GitHub's

My URL is the single source of truth. I want to ensure that we don't lose state when we refresh the page.

### Basic progressive enhancement using `prefers-reduced-motion`

Using the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query ensures that I don't subject users who prefer no motion to unnecessary animations. By default I offer a simple opacity change when hovering over a list item. If the media query satisfies `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`, then I add some additional animation.

### Promoting _fluid_ layout by using no media queries

I've been interested in the patterns outlined in the Every Layout web book. The focus is to not create separate designs for arbitrary screen sizes, but to instead create layouts and styles that naturally respond to the device used.

To help me, I used CSS utilities like the `min` function, in addition to utility classes like `switcher` that adjust layout based on the container's size.

## What would I do given more time?

### Syntax highlighting in the search

The GitHub search allows using boolean operators and keywords to refine searches. A neat feature would be to highlight valid keywords and boolean operators inside of the search input.

### Server-rendered components to void components _popping in_

Using a tool like Remix or Next.js would've allowed for server-rendered components. By generating the HTML on the server-side, the components would no longer change size before and after the data has loaded.

### Saving favouriting queries

Another neat feature would be to store the previous queries that someone's made. Saving them to localstorage means that they would persist across sessions.

### Adding sleeker enter/leaving transitions

Using a tool like Framer Motion or Motion One to create some sleek animation transitions when adding/removing items to the list. Or when changing pages. Since the last time I used React Router for page transitions, the API has changed pretty signficiantly, so it would've taken a bit of time to learn how to do page transitions.
